# Why I've moved from Github to Codeberg

## Microsoft Copilot, OpenAI, MechaHitler and "AI"
[This piece by former Github CEO Thomas Dohmke](https://ashtom.github.io/developers-reinvented) left a rather bad taste in my mouth. Obviously this piece was targeting investors, but the message to the users of Github - developers - is apparently that Microsoft (in partnership with OpenAI) wants Copilot to supplant them, while training Copilot the code they uploaded. I'm impressed how Microsoft managed to immediately make it worse by firing him and absorbing Github in Microsoft's CoreAI division - I suppose for not being sufficiently "AI fluent."

I put my work on Github in the hope that it might be useful to other people.
It was definitely not my intention to help [cryptocurrency peddlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_(blockchain)) to boost the valuation of their ~~investment scams~~ LLM businesses.

I think it's self-explanatory why I dislike the integration with the [Musk-owned chatbot](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content).

## Github's web interface is getting worse every day
What bugs me the most about Github these days isn't even ethics: It's how it basic usability has regressed. 10 years ago, clicking around on github.com was fast and generally worked well. The last couple of years everything has gotten horribly slow and broken. I've no idea how, but they've even managed to fuck up text search and selection on code view.

Codeberg is fast and actually works - like Github did 10 years ago.
